            saying, 'I have a prediction about the world that no one knows yet, because this gave me insight. Let's go
            test that prediction,' and have the prediction be correct.

            I can't tell you how many people say they were turned off from science because of a science teacher that
            completely sucked out all the inspiration and enthusiasm they had for the course.

            We have bred multiple generations of people who have not experienced knowing where you are the moment a news
            story broke, with that news story being great and grand and something that elevates society instead of
            diminishes it.</p>

                    It was unthinkable not long ago that a biologist or paleontologist would be at the same conference
                    as an
                    astrophysicist. Now we have accumulated so much data in each of these branches of science as it
                    relates
                    to origins that we have learned that no one discipline can answer questions of origins alone.

                    I want people to see that the cosmic perspective is simultaneously honest about the universe we live
                    in
                    and uplifting, when we realize how far we have come and how wonderful is this world of ours.
